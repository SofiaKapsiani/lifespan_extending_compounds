# Predicting lifespan-extending compounds

This repository contains the code for the “Random forest classification for predicting lifespan-extending chemical compounds” (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-93070-6) paper.

Ageing is a major risk factor for many conditions including cancer, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. Interventions that can prevent, delay or protect against age-related disorders are a growing research area. The DrugAge database consists of compounds that have been found to increase the lifespan of model organisms such as the worm, *Caenorhabditis elegans* (*C. elegans*). Random forest classifiers were built for predicting whether a chemical entry will “increase” or “not increase” the lifespan of *C. elegans*.  This repository contains the random forest models built with chemical descriptors and Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFPs).
